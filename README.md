# Vue SPA Migration & Enhancement

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vue that currently uses the Options API, Tailwind CSS, and Pinia for state management. The goal of this task is to modernize and expand the application by achieving the following:

- **Migrate to the Composition API:**  
  Refactor the existing components to use Vue's Composition API, enhancing code reusability and organization.

- **Use TypeScript:**  
  Convert the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript to leverage type safety and improve the developer experience.

- **Add vue-router:**  
  Integrate vue-router to manage application routes, allowing for a more structured multi-page SPA.

- **Implement a User Status Page:**  
  Develop a new page where users can view the status updates of other users.
